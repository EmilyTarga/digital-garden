# 2024-08-13-Digital Garden

I'll keep it short: this is a [digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden).

A little piece of internet land where I intend to plant some ideas and watch over them so they can grow healthy and strong. 

I read [**The Refined Mind** Digital Garden post](https://refinedmind.co/) and then [**Maxime Vaillancourt** Setting up your own digital garden with Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). *What a nice idea*, I thought. Highly recommend you checking them out. 

So here we are. Don't expect too much from it and I would love to hear your thoughts about it.
